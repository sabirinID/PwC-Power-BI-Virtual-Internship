# Background Information
All in on digital transformation: Creating a stronger, nimbler, more resilient future! 

We aim to build innovative technology solutions that differentiate us from our competitors and digitise the business. Part of that included a strategic decision to invest in upskilling programmes (https://www.pwc.com/gx/en/services/people-organisation/upskill-my-workforce-for-the-digital-world.html) so our people could learn how to use digital tools for data visualisation as well as automation, data cleansing and more.

If our people could use these tools to solve common problems, they’d help us become more efficient and growth-oriented now and more innovative later in Business Services and beyond. Now, employees are learning to build bots – over 2,400 have been created so far – to automate workflows. We continue to invest to make processes more intuitive using machine learning, PowerBI and eventually artificial intelligence (AI). These are key to working faster and solving problems differently for ourselves and our clients.

This is why you're here! Our Digital Accelerator programme is an internal chance that takes groups of our employees out of their day jobs and puts them through  trainings that teaches them skills in technology such as automation, machine learning, design thinking, and digital storytelling. PowerBI is an important part of it as visualising data helps to handle and understand clients. 

So, become a Digital Accelerator yourself and start your PowerBI journey with us!
