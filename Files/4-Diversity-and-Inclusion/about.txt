4: Diversity & Inclusion
Gender balance in the executive suite.

# Background Information
Human Resources at our telecom client is highly into diversity and inclusion. They’ve been working hard to improve gender balance at the executive management level, but they’re not seeing any progress. They’re reaching out to us for help.

But actually achieving this and unlocking its potential involves a whole set of practical challenges.

Why is this so?
